# Updated Tech Portfolio

# Why did I build this project?

To update my tech portfolio. This updated portfolio will include my Project 1 and Project 2 which was collaborative work as well as two exemplary homework assignments.

To also include an updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 2 and two exemplary assignments.
My motivation behind this is to prepare myself to be in a position to start applying for jobs by displaying my skills through my professional portfolio. Therefore having also inlcuded an updated Linkedin account and CV to better transition into a role as a web developer.
